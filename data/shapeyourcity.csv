Due to limitations in infrastructure capacity in the Corridor, City-initiated rezonings for townhouses will be phased to align with infrastructure upgrades. The first phase of City-initiated rezonings was approved by Council in September 2018, and aligns with the first area of infrastructure upgrades.</p><p>As part of the implementation of the Plan, sites designated for townhouse uses outside of the first stage of the City&rsquo;s infrastructure upgrades will be considered through privately-initiated rezoning applications, so long as these upgrades are secured as conditions of rezoning. Rather than rezoning these sites to a site-specific Comprehensive Development (CD) District, they will be rezoned to the RM-8A/RM-8AN zone. This will provide the same certainty on the built form for residents and applicants that the City-initiated rezoning provides, and will also streamline the rezoning process. Eligible properties within the Cambie Corridor may <a href=""https://vancouver.ca/home-property-development/rezone-your-property-to-rm-8a-rm-8an-or-i-1c.aspx"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">apply</a> for rezoning to RM-8A/AN townhouses..</p><p>The specific form of development will be reviewed through a future Development Permit process.

Due to limitations in infrastructure capacity in the Corridor, City-initiated rezonings for townhouses will be phased to align with infrastructure upgrades.

Rather than rezoning these sites to a site-specific Comprehensive Development (CD) District, they will be rezoned to the RM-8A/RM-8AN zone.

15857,projects,https://engagevancouver.ca.engagementhq.com/non-profit-affordable-housing,"<p>Vancouver is experiencing a severe shortage of housing that&rsquo;s affordable to low- and moderate- income renters. Over 50,000 renter households in the city pay more than 30% of their income on rent, with little income left over for other cost of living expenses. This means that many are struggling to make ends meet or living in housing that doesn&rsquo;t meet their needs.</p><p>One important source of non-market housing is housing owned and operated by non-profit societies and co-ops. Non-profit housing can accommodate a broad range of housing needs, including those of families, seniors, and singles who cannot afford market rental or ownership housing. However, there is a shortage of non-profit housing in Vancouver, and much of the existing non-profit housing in the city is aging and may be in need of renewal in coming years.</p><p>We&#39;re working on changes to streamline the development process for new non-profit housing in zoning districts covering select low-rise apartment areas across the city - RM-3A, RM-4, and RM-4N.</p><p>These areas consist of three storey condominium and rental apartment buildings. The proposed zoning amendments would allow non-profit social and co-op housing up to six storeys. This approach would be consistent with existing City policies and community plans, which prioritize the delivery of social and co-op housing for low and moderate income households.</p><div class=""fr-img-space-wrap""><span class=""fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib"" style=""width: 491px;""><span class=""fr-img-wrap""><img src=""https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ehq-production-canada/8f9f82bba2b59e788391e0e2bf913ad25ec5b692/original/1612486869/RM-3-4_SYC_Map.jpg_957b43a6eec17d71e2c25fed33ee861e?1612486869""><span class=""fr-inner""><span contenteditable=""true"">Map of RM-3A/4/4N Zoning outlined in purple and yellow</span></span></span></span></div><p class=""fr-img-space-wrap2"">These changes are intended to help existing non-profit societies and co-ops renew existing buildings and build more housing over time, to ensure the city has enough safe and secure non-market homes today and into the future.</p><hr><h2 style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Montserrat !important; font-weight: 500; line-height: 1.4; margin: 0px 0px 0.6em; font-size: 24px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); letter-spacing: -0.03em; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;""><span style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Approved at Public Hearing April 20, 2021</span></h2><p style=""box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 10px; font-family: Montserrat !important; word-break: break-word; line-height: 22px; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;""><span style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Council approved the amendments to the RM-4, RM-4N, and RM-3A to allow up to six stories for 100% social housing projects </span><span style=""box-sizing: border-box; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">on April 20, 2021.

Subsequently, a rezoning policy was adopted for the surrounding area to increase heights to the underside of the view cones and allow for the increased density that would come with that, such that greater public benefits (CACs) could be achieved. Within the immediate local context, five sites nearby to the Loops have developed with higher towers ranging from 378 to 415 feet. Also, the Higher Buildings Policy was amended to allow two extra high &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; towers on either side of the Granville Bridge, immediately to the south of the site (Vancouver House and 601 Beach Crescent). With all of these approvals for higher towers, the context for the Loops has changed since the Plan was adopted in 2010.</p><p>Added building height and density on the Loops site creates the opportunity to accommodate the expanded scope of engineering works and achieve greater public benefits than were anticipated in the 2010 Plan. The proposed increase in height from the Plan for sub-areas A and D is from 300 to 395 feet (to the underside of the view cone) and the proposed increase in height for sub-areas B and C is from 180 to 250 feet (above the bridge deck). Overall, approximately 243,000 sq. ft. of additional floor area is proposed, 100% of which is to consist of additional social housing, rental housing and a childcare.</p><p><strong>In response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus), an extended online question and answer (Q&amp;A) period was held in place of an in-person open house for this project.</strong></p><p><br></p><hr><p><br></p>",625-777 Pacific St rezoning application,625-777-pacific-st,archived,NA,TRUE,detailed,Public,"Rezoning, Downtown, Approved","Rezoning, Downtown, Approved",https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ehq-production-canada/cfd8a0b62297f1e999e7b5c994d2fab4ad0eb49f/original/1621036244/aab66953fb9729531458ef9250987ec3_loops.png?1621036244,777 Pacific St (Granville Loops) - Looking north west from above,NA,textwrap_default,0,5883,FALSE,2021-05-28T17:35:23-04:00,0,1,,tool,2021-01-06T13:12:18-05:00,2022-08-11T18:00:17-04:00,"<p><strong>This application was approved by Council at Public Hearing on July 12, 2022</strong></p>",FALSE,157,FALSE,participant,TRUE,NA,15404,NA,NA,NA

At their peak, in the 1920s, there were approximately 260 active corner stores. However, when the first zoning bylaw was introduced, these stores were seen as less desirable, and planning regulations made them hard to build. The number of stores has been declining ever since.</p><p>Over the last few decades, there has been a renewed interest in supporting corner stores. Some small changes to zoning regulations have been made, but there is the opportunity to do more.</p><p>More recently, in 2022, Council approved the Vancouver Plan &ndash; a long-range strategy to guide growth and change in the city. One of the core objectives of the Plan is the creation of more complete neighbourhoods, where people have easy access to daily and weekly needs. Corner stores could play a role in helping to achieve that goal.</p><p><strong>Get involved!</strong></p><p><strong>Our fall 2023 survey is now closed</strong>; however our digital mapping feature will remain open for a few more days. If you&#39;ve got a story to share about a favourite corner store, click on the &quot;Map&quot; tab below and follow the instructions. </p><p>For more on the corner store project, read our<strong> background materials </strong>under<strong> Related Documents</strong> (English only).</p><p>Your feedback will be used to inform future policy and regulatory changes expected to take place in 2024.

Due to limitations in infrastructure capacity in the Corridor, City-initiated rezonings for townhouses will be phased to align with infrastructure upgrades. The first phase of City-initiated rezonings was approved by Council in September 2018, and aligns with the first area of infrastructure upgrades.</p><p>As part of the implementation of the Plan, sites designated for townhouse uses outside of the first stage of the City&rsquo;s infrastructure upgrades will be considered through privately-initiated rezoning applications, so long as these upgrades are secured as conditions of rezoning. Rather than rezoning these sites to a site-specific Comprehensive Development (CD) District, they will be rezoned to the RM-8A/RM-8AN zone. This will provide the same certainty on the built form for residents and applicants that the City-initiated rezoning provides, and will also streamline the rezoning process.

During this period we engaged with the public on the plan in several ways, including an online survey, online information sessions and community pop-up sessions.

(north building) with additional height for a rooftop amenity space in the south building; and</li><li>37 vehicle parking spaces and 170 bicycle parking spaces.</li></ul><p><a href=""https://rezoning.vancouver.ca/applications/7280fraserst/index.htm"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank""></a></p><p>The application is being considered under the <a href=""https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/zoning/policy-rezoning-secured-rental.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Secured Rental Policy.</a></p><p>The previous application proposing to rezone from R1-1 (Residential Inclusive) district to RR-2B (Residential Rental) district has been withdrawn. Key changes from the previous version include:</p><ul><li>Rezoning to site-specific CD-1.</li><li>Addition of a four-storey residential building fronting the lane.</li></ul><p>The new application proposes rezoning to CD-1, as the site&rsquo;s irregularity in terms of depth and slope meant an RR District was not workable. The site&rsquo;s depth and existing rear lane provide flexibility for an additional rear (north) building on site, in keeping with the Secured Rental Policy (SRP). The proposed rear (north) apartment building appears as 3 storeys from the internal courtyard and 4 storeys at the lane, given the site&rsquo;s slope. The proposal meets the intent of the SRP Policy and generally complies with the accompanying <a href=""https://guidelines.vancouver.ca/guidelines-rr-districts.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Residential Rental Districts Schedules Design Guidelines</a>.</p><p><strong>Application drawings and statistics on this webpage are posted as-submitted to the City.

An engagement summary will be published here in Spring-Summer 2024 to reflect what we heard from you. </strong></p><p>The Vancouver Park Board is planning a new plaza and riverfront park in the East Fraser Lands (EFL), also known as the River District. This plaza and park, along with the new community centre, are part of the larger vision of parks and recreation spaces for the growing neighbourhood.</p><p>The future community centre and plaza will be located between Oolichan Way to the west, Road G to the north, River District Crossing to the east. A new riverfront park will be located to the south of the plaza. The riverfront park will form part of a continuous stretch of parkland along the Fraser River from Kerr to Boundary Rd.</p><p>The concepts for the plaza and park were created as part of the developer&rsquo;s application to the City for a Preliminary Development Permit (PDP). Preliminary development permits are needed for complex projects like this one.

The proposal is for a City-initiated rezoning of certain areas of Broadway and Cambie Corridor to new low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise district schedules. These district schedules will standardize regulations across the applicable plan areas and simplify the development approvals process.</p><p>If approved, this initiative would eliminate the need for owners to apply for a rezoning on each individual site. Instead, applicants could proceed directly to a development permit application.</p><p>The new zoning would allow for multi-family buildings from approximately four to 22 storeys, depending on site conditions, in areas close to transit and commercial centres. Consistent with approved plan policies, the highest density buildings under this zone would be required to include affordable housing and/or childcare, and may choose to provide local-serving retail or service spaces. Lower-density development options that currently exist on these parcels would remain (such as under R1-1 zoning). The new district schedules will be accompanied by guidelines that will provide additional guidance on urban design aspects.</p><p>This project is one of the implementation initiatives under the Vancouver Plan, which includes direction to simplify, clarify and consolidate plans, policies and regulations to improve the development process. These proposed changes would allow housing projects to be built faster with less cost, giving priority to providing homes for people who need them and working toward maintaining diversity in the city.</p><p><a href=""https://www.shapeyourcity.ca/47282/widgets/200090/documents/148516"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Learn more about the proposed zoning changes [PDF - 4 MB]</a>.</p></div><div class=""OutlineElement Ltr SCXW46496933 BCX8""><br></div>",City-initiated zoning changes (rezoning) in areas of Broadway and Cambie Corridor Plans ,zoning-changes-broadway-cambie-plans,published,NA,TRUE,detailed,Public,Rezoning,Rezoning,https://s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/ehq-production-canada/fde0edd3cdab7349f7dcd1fc3b04bd760799e65b/original/1740593379/3907e872eb8dddfa00825977057e5b65_City-initiated%20Zoning%20Changes%20-%20Cover%20image%201.png?1740593379,724 E 56th Ave - Looking southwest from the street,NA,textwrap_default,0,0,FALSE,2025-03-04T10:12:49-08:00,0,3,,tool,2025-02-12T14:10:24-08:00,2025-07-24T14:15:13-07:00,NA,FALSE,421,FALSE,participant,TRUE,NA,15404,NA,NA,NA
